		<h1>Core Design System</h1>
		<p class="small font-sans inset-b-l">Pattern Lab, Sketch UI, Front-end Development, Documentation</p>

		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>What started as static Photoshop and PDF files has become a fully functioning design system, complete with a development framework, Sketch UI library, documentation and guidelines with nearly a dozen regular contributors.</li>
			<li>The design system serves multiple web properties, supports third-party vendors and has led to sibling systems that support other channels like mobile and email.</li>
			<li>The inertia around the system has given a voice to <a href="lt-accessibility.html">accessibility efforts</a> and inspired the creation of enterprise design principles.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>Like any good digital story this one starts with paper and static assets. In early 2015, when I joined Life Time’s internal agency as a digital designer the styles and patterns for web properties were maintained within Photoshop and documented in PDFs. There had been previous attempts to collect and share assets, but those were static—sites with no shared code between development or other teams. Design was essentially being documented in finalized comps before being passed on to dev.</p>

		<h2>Objective</h2>
		<p>The target would be to stand up an easy-to-maintain dynamic website that could display and document existing styles and patterns with semantic markup. At this early stage the technology team wasn’t keen on designers coding (I had done front-end development previously) so one of the goals was to proceed in a way that built trust between teams while keeping clear of “prod.” This site would be the agency’s styleguide and source of truth for any web work, and do so in a way that was transparent with more parity to a final developed state.</p>

		<h2>Method</h2>

		<p>From previous efforts I knew that a static site was not the right approach. Given our existing styles and patterns, frameworks were also out of the question due to the amount of customization that would be required and lack of congruity with our existing markup patterns. Around this same time <a href="http://patternlab.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pattern Lab<span class="ext-ref">(external link)</span><span aria-hidden="true"></span></a> was gaining traction, fueled by Brad Frost’s <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomic Design<span class="ext-ref">(external link)</span><span aria-hidden="true"></span></a> principles. I had used it for clients before and knew it’d be a good place to start.</p>

		<blockquote><p>We just needed to prove that a resource like this could bring two or more disciplines closer together and improve the efficacy of the work.</p></blockquote>

		<p>I made a good friend from one of the development teams and he had a shared passion for a resource like this. And while not a method in the traditional sense—although one that I think is used more often than gets talked about—we adopted an <em>under the radar</em> approach. We didn’t need to propose a design systems team or even ask for an official project, we just needed to prove that a resource like this could bring two or more disciplines closer together and improve the efficacy of the work.</p>

		<p>Together we stood up a site using the PHP version of Pattern Lab, and started documenting our styles and patterns in an atomic structure. We set it behind employee credentials and maintained it within a simple repo.</p>

		<h2>Outcomes</h2>
		<p>It’s been over three years since I launched the first iteration, and I’m happy to say that Life Time is now experiencing the massive benefits that a design system can offer. The <em>Core Enterprise Design System</em> (or <em>Core</em> for short), as it’s been branded, is more than the styleguide it started out as.</p>

		<img src="/img/core-parts.svg" alt="The 3 parts of Core: Core Framework, Core Design Guidelines, Core UI">

		<p>Today we view the system as the sum of three parts. The First is the <em>Core Framework</em> that includes the component library, documentation and development dependencies. Now on the Node version of Pattern Lab, the site is Bootstrap 4 flavored, theme-able and contains 100% production-ready styles, markup and function.</p>

		<p>The second part is the <em>Core Design Guidelines</em>. This is where the atomic structure is flattened out for designers, authors and business owners in the form of a pattern library. It references live examples from the <em>Core Framework</em> as a single source of truth. Documentation for each example includes an overview and a <em>Usage</em> section with rules, constraints, principles, accessibility requirements and class/configuration tables for authoring. A standalone <em>Guidelines</em> section includes our point of view on concepts like content strategy, performance and user experience while offering a robust section on accessibility that includes a checklist and four-step approach to preforming an accessibility audit. Lastly, guides are provided for creating fluid media assets and working with SVG.</p>

		<p>The final section is the <em>Core UI</em> styleguide. This is the cloud-based Sketch library for all design assets needed to create new experiences.</p>

		<p><em>Core</em> has full VP and department manager support and nearly a dozen contributors across five teams. Multiple web properties and third-party integrations rely on its patterns. It is the go-to resource for our accessibility efforts. And while <em>Core</em> answers many questions, it also asks a few, which is why we’re now in the midst of capturing our design principles. As you may have guessed, they will also live within the system as we continue to build on the foundation that represents our current state and lays the groundwork for the future.</p>
