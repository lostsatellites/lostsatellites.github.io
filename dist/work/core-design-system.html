		<h1>Core Design System</h1>
		<p class="small font-sans inset-b-l">Pattern Lab, Sketch UI, Front-end Development, Documentation</p>

		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>What started as static Photoshop and PDF files has become a fully functioning design system, complete with a development framework, Sketch UI library, documentation and guidelines with nearly a dozen regular contributors.</li>
			<li>The design system serves multiple web properties, supports third-party vendors and has led to sibling systems that support other channels like mobile and email.</li>
			<li>The inertia around the system has given a voice to <a href="lt-accessibility.html">accessibility efforts</a> and inspired the creation of enterprise design principles.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>Like any good digital story this one starts with paper and static assets. When I started working at Life Time as part of the internal agency in early 2016 all of the styles and patterns for web properties were maintained within Photoshop and documented in PDFs. It wasn’t that they hadn’t attempted to have documentation on a website before, they had, but those were static—sites created by the agency with no shared code between development or other teams. At this point in time the process was very much design tossed over the wall, which didn’t benefit collaboration.</p>

		<h2>Objective</h2>
		<p>The objective was quite simple at the start, stand up a dynamic website that could display and document existing styles. It might’ve been simple, but that didn’t make it easy. At this early stage the technology team wasn’t keen on designers coding (I had done front-end development previously) so one of the goals was to proceed in a way that built trust between teams while keeping clear of “prod.” This site would be the agency’s styleguide and source of truth for any web work that was handed over to dev.

		<h2>Method</h2>
		<p>From previous efforts I knew that a static site was not the right approach. Given our existing styles and patterns frameworks were also out of the question due to the amount of customization that would be required and lack of parity with our existing markup patterns. Around this same time <a class="link-underlined" href="http://patternlab.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pattern Lab<span class="ext-ref">(external link)</span><span aria-hidden="true"></span></a> was gaining traction, fueled by Brad Frost’s <a class="link-underlined" href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomic Design<span class="ext-ref">(external link)</span><span aria-hidden="true"></span></a> principles. I had some familiarity with it from previous experiences and knew it’d be a good place to start.</p>

		<p>It’s probably worth noting that this wasn’t an officially sanctioned project yet. We had to fly under the radar a bit to prove out the concept and win some ground to stand on.</p>

		<h3>Make Friends</h3>

		<p>You might’ve noticed that I just said “we,” that’s because I made a good connection in one of the development teams who had a shared passion for. Making friends is definitely a method I push for any time grassroots efforts are greening up. In a previous role I’d served as the designer for a team of 8–11 developers</p>
